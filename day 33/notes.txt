Spring framework is a framework of frameworks since it provides support for multiple frameworks such as structs, hibernate,
 ejb and so on

Framework can be defined as a structure where we find solutions for various problems

Spring comprises
ioc
aop
dao
context
orm
web mvc
and more

Advantages
predefined templates -- provides templates for jdbc, hibernate, jpa and more
loose coupling -- It uses dependcy injection
easy testing - 
lightweight -- it's lightweight because of it's pojo implementation
fast development
powerful abstraction
declarative support

Spring Modules
Test
Spring Core Container
data access / integration

Ioc Container
The ioc container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects
the ioc container gets information from the xml file
The iocs main tasks are
first instantiate the application
second configure the object
third assemble dependencies between the objects

There are two types of ioc containers
BeanFactory
Application context

Beanfactory vs application context
org.springframework.bean.factory.beanfactory
org springframework.context.applicationcontext interface act as ioc container

the application interface is built on top of the beanfactory interface. it adds some extra functionality
onto the beanfactory such as simple intergration with spring aop. Message resource, application layer specific
context for web apps

so it's better to use applicationcontext than beanfactory

Dependacy Injection in spring
Di is a design pattern that removes the dependency from the programming code so that it can
be easy to manage and test the app.
Di makes our programing code loosly coupled

there are mainly two problem of dependency lookups
1. Tight coupling the dependency lookup approach makes the code tightly coupled, if resources are changed
we will need to make lots of changes to the code.
2. It makes testing harder espcially for black box testing

the framework provides two ways to inject dependencys
by constructor
or setter method

dependency injection by constructor 
we can inject the dependency by constructor by constructor-arg subelement of bean
we can have
	primitive and string based values
	dependent objects
	collection values

dependency injection via setter method
the property subelement of bean is used for setting injection

differnces between constructor and setter injection
partial dependency can be injected usinng setter
